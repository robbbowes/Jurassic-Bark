BRIEF:

Animal Shelter

The Scottish Animal Shelter accepts orphaned or stray animals and takes care of them until they can be adopted by a new owner. 
The shelter has a list of potential new owners for the animals. 
Animals may take a while to be trained up and made healthy before being available for adoption.
They are looking for a management system to keep track of their animals and owners.

MVP:
A list of all their animals and their admission date . MET
Mark an animal as being adoptable/not adoptable . MET
Assign an animal to a new owner . MET
List all the owners and their adopted animals . MET

Possible Extensions:
CRUD actions for animals/owners . MET
Have separate pages for animals ready for adoption and ones still in training/vet care . MET (Only animals that are ready to be adopted can be)
Search for animals by breed/type . MET
Any other ideas you might come up with . MET (Great site name!  Pictures for animals and owners)

WHAT I'D LIKE TO CHANGE/ADD:

Generally happy with the result after 4 weeks worth of Ruby, Sinatra, SQL.
UI/UX improvements - sort out the CSS as it's a little messy.
Images need to be in the added and then assigned via filename, not ideal.
